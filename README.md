A web Based Application to Predict air pollution
## About
We forecast the air quality of India by using machine learning to predict the air quality index of a given area. 
Air quality index of India is a standard measure used to indicate the pollutant (so2, no2, rspm, spm. etc.) levels over a period.
We developed a model to predict the air quality index based on historical data of previous years and predicting over a particular upcoming year as a Gradient decent boosted multivariable regression problem.

## Result
Since our model is capable of predicting the current data with 95% accuracy it will successfully predict the upcoming air quality index of any particular data within a given region. With this model we can forecast the AQI and alert the respected region of the country also it a progressive learning model it is capable of tracing back to the particular location needed attention provided the time series data of every possible region needed attention. 
The essential perspectives that should be viewed as with regards to guaging of the poison focus are its different sources alongside the components that impact its fixation.
